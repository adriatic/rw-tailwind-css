# rw-tailwind-css

This sample is the Typescript variant of the [React components SaaS startup landing with RedwoodJS and Tailwind CSS in 10 minutes](https://dev.to/spanarin/react-components-saas-startup-landing-with-redwoodjs-and-tailwind-css-in-10-minutes-3hc4) written by [Sergey Panarin]((https://github.com/spanarin))

In order to make this app a bit more interesting, I am using the [basic (free) Tailwind](https://tailwindtemplates.co/templates/basic) template, which comes with a refreshing, modern, impressive, and high-quality design, intended to use for any kind of landing page.
